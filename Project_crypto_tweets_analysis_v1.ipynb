    "Given that everyone going different things for the project I want you to add a short  description in your notebook. There are up to six things that I want.\n",
    "\n",
    "First if you are working on a team then include the names and Red IDs of both team members at the top of the readme file. Just have one person submit the project so I don’t end up grading the same project twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second a brief description of what the project does. What are the goals of your assignment? Did you succeed? What did you learn. In the assignments I knew what you were to do. So if you just had code and tables I could figure things out. In your project you need to explain what your code is doing and what the output of your code means. In Jupyter notebooks you can use markdown cells to contain text. Use the markdown cells to to explain your code and results as they are easier to read then comments in code. Use the markdown cells to add headers (Introduction, How to Run, Results, etc) to give the notebook some structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Third any special instructions that I need to run the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth if you use any third party libraries list them and give the pip command needed to install them. A sentence or two on what the library does for you. If your idea comes from a site like Kaggle include a link to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fifth a list know issues with the project. If a feature is not working let me know. If a feature is not working I will grade it more severe than if you do not tell me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Six do not upload large data files. If your total upload to the course portal is 5 MB you will be fine. If people start uploading large files to the course portal the server will crash causing you and other people in the class to panic. (I need to rewrite that server.) If you data file puts you over that limit add a command in your jupyter notebook that will  download your data file from its source. The following command in a code cell on a Unix machine will download covid data at the given https address to the local file covid.csv.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code takes a long time to run on the original data set then I would like a smaller dataset to run while grading. If the file is small enough it can be combined with your notebook and up loaded. If not provide a method to download the file: dropbox link, Google drive link, etc. If you are not able to do this contact me to make other arrangements. Always include a link to access the original data set file.\n",
